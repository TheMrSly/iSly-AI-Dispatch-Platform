- Generates assignment notifications

#### Route Optimization Agent
- Analyzes active loads for route improvements
- Calculates fuel savings and distance reductions
- Updates load records with optimized routes
- Reports significant savings to dispatchers

#### Fuel Optimization Agent
- Monitors driver fuel levels (simulated)
- Finds best fuel prices along routes
- Generates fuel stop recommendations
- Tracks potential cost savings

#### Compliance Agent
- Monitors Hours of Service (HOS) compliance
- Checks for license and permit expirations
- Generates violation alerts and warnings
- Tracks compliance metrics

#### Customer Communication Agent
- Sends automated load status updates
- Generates delivery confirmations
- Provides ETA notifications
- Maintains communication logs
